    "This introduction to Python should provide students with some basic, skills for getting started programming with Python. If you take the time to build a bit of a foundation now, then as the need arises in your future courses you can work on growing your skills over time--it is well worth the effort for anyone in STEM disciplines to develop this skill. \n",

That means you don't need to perform a special installation of Python on your own computer and you can get started programming directly using this web-hosted interface. There are comments, example code, and a series of tasks for you to complete. It is a good idea to try tinkering with the code a bit so you can get an idea of how it works. Looking up some Python guides online is also a great idea--there are many on the internet and there are a few resources at the end of this document.\n",

Then imagine each row of the square matrix represents the length of leg 2 of a right triangle, with values 0, 1, 2, ... 10. Now, create an empty matrix m where the two indices of the matrix will represent the leg lengths and the value of a matrix element will represent the hypotenuse length. Then use two nested loops (one for row and one for column) to loop over all elements of the array and to assign the value of the array using the Pythagorean theorem. For instance, m[3,4]=5 and m[0,2]=2. Finally, use print to have Python display your matrix. It will look better if you round to one decimal place.

    "## Plots\n",
    "Displaying data in the form of plots is often easier to understand than just displaying numeric values using the print function. It is possible to make really elaborate plots using Python, particularly with the matplotlib library, but here we will use a collection within the matplotlib library called pyplot. So we will import matplotlib.pyplot. You can find lots of details online on how to use pyplot online to control size, color, tick marks, line thickness, multiple overlayed plots, etc. E.g., https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html or https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html\n"

You will see both contain text. The file 'sample_data_1.txt' is a 2D matrix containing 1024 rows and 2 columns. The file 'sample_data_2.qmbl' has a bunch of xml markup code that you can ignore.
